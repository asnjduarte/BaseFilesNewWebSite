To install the phpunit test run the following in a new Visual Studio Code terminal (10 was available but it was not compatible with my php version).
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit ^9 

To run the addBaseFileUnitPhpTesting.php file, add it to the root or main directory of your project. 
Type the following in your visual studio code terminal: php .\addBaseFileUnitPhpTesting.php

The base file includes the directories and few examples of tests two class objects.
