# BaseFilesNewWebSite
Create list of base files for a new web site

This project is to help me create a local custom wordpress site much quicker where I can choose various types of menu designs, footer designs, drop down menu designs, etc. It also helps to setup phpunit tests, caching, etc. without me having to cut and copy code from old projects and lookup commands again.

I would like to be able to add various menu designs, footer designs, drop down menu design, image galleries, two-column areas, three-column areas, etc. The idea is to help choose which design I want and simply add it into my project.
